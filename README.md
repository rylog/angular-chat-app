# Angular Chat App
This is a web app I created while learning the MEAN stack. It is a basic chat app that uses socket.io to send messages between users. 
I was planning on adding MongoDB to create different channels and to save conversations. 
Currently it is deployed on Heroku, here is the link (https://mingler-client.herokuapp.com/)

## App Idea
I wanted to create a chat app so my friends and I could send each other messages through any device that had access to internet.
I also wanted to further understand server code and instant messaging.

## Difficulties Encountered
I had never had any prior experience deploying apps so it was a struggle to finally get the web app online.
I had also separated the client and server code which made it difficult to deploy to Heroku. 
Big shoutout to stack overflow for solving my problems!
